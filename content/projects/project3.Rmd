# First, lets look at the data 
```{r, include=FALSE}
world_happiness_report_2019 <- read_csv("~/desktop/Hanna-website/data/2019.csv")
```

```{r}
skim(world_happiness_report_2019)
```

# Second, lets look at happiness by country

```{r}
whr_19 <- world_happiness_report_2019 %>% 
  rename(country = `Country or region`) %>%  
  rename(GDP= `GDP per capita`) %>% 
  rename(Social_support=`Social support`) %>% 
  rename(Life_exp=`Healthy life expectancy`) %>% 
  rename(Freedom=`Freedom to make life choices`) %>% 
  rename(Corruption=`Perceptions of corruption`)

#add continent column to world_happiness report data 
whr_19$continent <- countrycode(sourcevar = whr_19[["country"]],
                             origin = "country.name",
                             destination = "continent") 

#summarize data by continent
by_continent <- whr_19 %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  summarise(score_con=mean(Score)) %>% 
  na.omit()

#create a ggplot showing happiness in all countries with colors according to continent 
ggplot(by_continent,aes(
  x=reorder(continent,score_con),
  y=score_con, 
  fill=continent))+

#bar chart format 
  geom_col()+

#add labels
  labs(x="Continent", y="Average Happiness Score",title = "Oceania is the happiest continent
       ", subtitle = "Average Happiness Score by country")+
    
#add theme
    theme_economist()+
    
    theme(legend.position = "none")+
    
    NULL
```

# What makes people in Oceania so happy?

## First let's look at the different countries within Oceania
```{r}
#filter data for Oceania
oceania <- whr_19 %>% 
  filter(continent=="Oceania")

#create ggplot for Oceania
ggplot(oceania, 
       aes(x=country, 
           y=Score, 
           fill= country))+
  
  geom_col()+
  
# make sure y axis goes up to 8 
  expand_limits(y=c(0,8))+

# add labels
  labs(title = "Australia and New Zealand are equally happy
       ",
       subtitle="Average Happiness Scores in Oceania", 
       x="Country", 
       y="Happiness Score")+
  
#add theme
  theme_economist()+
    
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
    
  NULL
  
  
  
```

## People in New Zealand and Australia appear to be equally happy, but what is different in these countries? 

Let's plot the relationship between Happiness Score and a few key indicators

```{r}

#create subset for highlighted points
highlight_oceania <- whr_19 %>% 
  filter(continent=="Oceania")

#create geom_point plot 
ggplot(whr_19,
       aes(x=GDP,y=Score, colour=continent))+
  geom_point()+

# add one geom-point for highlighted points
 geom_point(data=highlight_oceania, 
            aes(x=GDP,
                y=Score, 
                size=2.5))+

# add labels
  labs(title="The higher the GDP, the higher the happiness score
       ",
       subtitle = "Relationship between Happiness Score and GDP", 
       y="Happiness Score")+
  
#add theme
  theme_economist()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")
         
```


The graph shows that unsurprisingly, there is a strong positive relationship between GDP per capita and Happiness Score. You can see that many of the countries in the continents that have a high average happiness score are positioned in the upper corner of the graph e.g. Oceania (represented by larger points), while the countries in the continents that have a low average happiness score are in the lower corner. 

## But money can't be everything. So let's look at a few more variables, but to not forget about GDP the size of the point will now represent their GDP

```{r}

#create geom_point plot 
ggplot(whr_19,
       aes(x=Social_support,y=Score, colour=continent,size=GDP, alpha=0.3))+
  geom_point()+

# add labels
  labs(title="The higher social support, the higher the happiness score
       ",
       subtitle = "Relationship between happiness score and social support", x="
       Social Support",
       y="Happiness Score
       ")+
  
#add theme
  theme_economist()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")
         
```
```{r}

#create geom_point plot 
ggplot(whr_19,
       aes(x=Life_exp,y=Score, colour=continent,size=GDP, alpha=0.3))+
  geom_point()+

# add labels
  labs(title="The higher life expectancy, the happier the people
       ",
       subtitle = "Relationship between happiness score and life expectancy", 
       x="
       Life Expectancy",
       y="Happiness Score
       ")+
  
#add theme
  theme_economist()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")
         
```
## Overall we can conclude that a high GDP, social support and a high life expectancy contribute to the overall happiness within a country.
