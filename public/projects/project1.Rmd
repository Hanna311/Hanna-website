### In this project I will look at how covid-19 death rates are affected by variables such as gender, age, cormorbidities and whether the patient has been admitted to the ICU. For this purpose I will create two graphs: 

### 1. By age group, sex, and whether the patient had co-morbidities or not
### 2. By age group, sex, and whether the patient was admited to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or not

### Given that the data for those graphs is provided only for the USA, I will consequently also have a look at the development ofthe pandemic within selected european countries. 

```{r, cache=TRUE}

# Covid cases in other countries 

## Given that this data was collected by the CDC it only provides information on the covid epidemic in the US. As an european I would like to have a closer look at how Covid-19 has developed in Europe.

```{r}
#download the data
covid_more<- read_csv("~/desktop/Hanna-website/data/coviddata.csv")

#have a look at the data
skim(covid_more)
```


## First let's compare the number of total cases in a few European countries
```{r}

covid_europe <- covid_more %>%
  
#filter data for countries
  filter(location %in% c("United Kingdom", "Germany","France","Sweden", "Switzerland"))

```
```{r}
ggplot(covid_europe, aes(x=date, y=total_cases, fill=location))+
  
#choose graph type
  geom_col()+
  
#facet by country
  facet_wrap(~location)+
  
#add labels
  labs(title = "France & the United Kingdom have most covid cases
       ", 
        x="
       Time", 
       y="Total Cases
       ")+
  
#choose theme and remove legend
  theme_economist()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  NULL
```

## Now that we know that the UK and France have the highest total number of covid cases. Let's have a look at the measures these countries have put in place in response. 
```{r}
ggplot(covid_europe, aes(x=date, y=stringency_index, color=location))+
  
#choose graph type
   geom_line()+

# add labels
  labs(title = "France had the strictest covid measures
       ", x="
       Time", 
       y="Stringency Index
       ")+

# choose theme & legend position & title
  theme_economist()+
  theme(legend.position = "right")+
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())+
  NULL
```

## As you can see from the Graph the UK and France also have the strictest covid measures as measured by the stringency index. 

## Now let's have a look at whether strict measures have an effect on daily new cases.
```{r}
ggplot(covid_europe, aes(x=date, y=new_cases, color=stringency_index))+
  
#choose graph type
  geom_point()+

# choose color scale
  scale_color_gradient(low="blue", high="red")+
  
# add labels
  labs(title = "Strict measures lead to lower case numbers
       ", x="
       Time", 
       y="New Cases
       ")+
  
#change legend title
  guides(color=guide_legend("Stringency Index"))+
  
#facet wrap by country
  facet_wrap(~location)+
  
#choose theme
  theme_economist()+
  
  NULL
```

## Now onto what we really care about: is there any country in this world where you do not have to adhere to strict covid measures? Well I have created a map. 

```{r}
#Transform data
covid_measures <- covid_more %>%

#select only relevant variables
  select(iso_code,location,date,stringency_index) %>%

#rename some columns for join with 
  rename(
    region = location,
   Stringency = stringency_index
    ) %>% 
#rename United States to USA for left join
  mutate(
    region = ifelse(region == "United States", "USA", region)
    ) %>% 

#filter for a recent date (i choose this because there were only few stringency index values available for more recent data)
  filter(date=="2020-10-01")
```

```{r}
#create world map data frame
world_map <- map_data("world")

#join data frames
covid_measures_map <- left_join(covid_measures, world_map, by = "region")

```

```{r}
#plot 
ggplot(covid_measures_map, aes(map_id = region, fill = Stringency))+

#choose geom_map
  geom_map(map = covid_measures_map,  color = "white")+

#adapt limits of x and y scale
  expand_limits(x = covid_measures_map$long, y = covid_measures_map$lat)+

#select scale fill
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "C")+
  
#add labels
  labs(title= "Most countries currently have intermediate measures in place",subtitle = "Current stringency level of covid measures in the world", x="",y="")+
  coord_fixed(ratio = 1.35)+
  NULL
```
